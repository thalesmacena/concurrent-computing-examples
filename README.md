## ðŸ“‘ About

This repository is a list of examples of the implementation of concurrent computing done in C using the POSIX Threads library, built during the discipline of Concurrent Computing at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and taught by Prof. [Silvana Rossetto](https://dcc.ufrj.br/~silvana/) (DCC-- UFRJ)

**It is recommended that you use a Linux, macOS or WSL system if you use windows to run and run programs**

## ðŸ§© Examples

#### [Hello World](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/tree/main/src/examples/helloWorld)
First notion of creating threads to create a hello world in multiple threads and present the concept of concurrent computing

#### [Increment Array](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/tree/main/src/examples/incrementArray)
Shows the use of threads to manipulate arrays, increasing the value of each position by 1

#### [Matrix multiplication by vector](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/tree/main/src/examples/matrixVector)
Program that performs the multiplication of a matrix by a vector, has a sequential version and versions with different concurrent solutions.

#### [Matrix multiplication by Matrix](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/tree/main/src/examples/matrixMultiplication)
Program that performs the multiplication of a square matrix by a square matrix, has a sequential version and a concurrent version. In the folder you will also find a [benchmark](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/blob/main/src/examples/matrixMultiplication/benchmark.md) analysis on the advantages of a concurrent approach.

#### [Array reduce sum](https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples/tree/main/src/examples/arrayReduce)
Program that traverses an array of double and adds their values

## âœ¨ Installation
Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```PowerShell
# To copy this repository
git clone https://github.com/thalesmacena/concurrent-computing-examples.git

# To move to project directory
cd concurrent-computing-examples
```

## ðŸ”¥ Running
You can run each example by running its respective .exe file or build with the command:

```Powershell
gcc fileName -o exitName -Wall -lpthread
./exitName args
```
